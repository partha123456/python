Rules for creating variable in github:
1)Variable is a name which is used to refer memory location. Variable also known as identifier and used to hold value.
2)Variable names can be a group of both letters and digits, but they have to begin with a letter or an underscore.
3)All the characters except the first character may be an alphabet of lower-case(a-z), upper-case (A-Z), underscore or digit (0-9).
4)Identifier name must not contain any white-space, or special character (!, @, #, %, ^, &, *).
5)Identifier name must not be similar to any keyword defined in the language.
6)Identifier names are case sensitive for example myname, and MyName is not the same.
7)Examples of valid identifiers : a123, _n, n_9, etc.
8)Examples of invalid identifiers: 1a, n%4, n 9, etc.
9)Python allows us to assign a value to multiple variables in a single statement which is also known as multiple assignment.
We can apply multiple assignments in two ways either by assigning a single value to multiple variables or assigning multiple values to multiple variables.
10)Variables can hold values of different data types.
